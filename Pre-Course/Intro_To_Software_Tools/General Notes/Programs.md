# Bash Commands

Options begin with - or -- and a single character typically follows a - and a single word generally follows the --.

*Note:* Anything you can access on your computer (files, pdfs, etc.) can also be accessed through the CLI.

How?
1. Identify where you are (pwd)
2. List directory contents (ls).  
    *Note:* Names ending in / are folders.
3. ls arguments: Pass the name of a folder as an argument to ls (ls Documents/)
4. Options
    - Show hidden files (-a(--all)) (hidden files appear preceeded by a .)
    - Show metadata (-l)
    - ls --help (shows other options)
    - -al combines the two options -a and -l.
        - -a = the command applies to every file
        - -l = requests the files display in long format
    - Change Directory (cd): Always expect one argument (the path to the directory of your choice)
