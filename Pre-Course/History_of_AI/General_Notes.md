## Leveraging AI to Learn

**Suggested Practices:**

- Have AI check your understanding of new concepts. (Explain the concept in your own words, and have it critique your explaination).
- Ask AI to quiz you, by asking you questions, one at a time, about concepts that you are studying.
- For more complex problems, ask it to help you break the problem down into smaller steps.
- Work with it to explore some project ideas. It's never too early to start thinking about ways to apply and practice your new skills!

*Tips*

The wording of your prompt is very important. Be sure your prompt includes context and limitations.

**Provide Context**

*Examples:*

(Give AI context stating you are a novice or beginner programmer learning JavaScript and asking it to use common, everyday language)

1. Explain what a variable is in programming.
2. I'm a beginning programming student larning JavaScript. I'm struggling with the concept of a variable. Explain variables and how they work using common everyday language.
3. I'm a beginning programming student learning JavaScript. Explain variables and how they work using common everyday language in no more than 5 sentences.

**Provide Limitations**

*Examples:*

(You can also provide information on how much or how little information or detail the AI should include in its generated response)

1. I've forgotten how to output a message to the console in JavaScript. I need to combine two strings together and display the result.
2. I need to write a function in JavaScript to greet a user by their name. Don't write the entire function, just help me get started with the function declaration.
3. I'm a beginning programming student learning JavaScript. I need to write a function to output a greeting for a user to teh console. I think this function should take the user's name as an input parameter and return the message string. Does this seem correct? Don't give me the code for a solution.

(Unlike context, you should always include your limitations, particularly when using the tools to assist with learning.)
