# Expressions

Expressions all resolve or *evaluate* to a value, whether they're a simple literal, or the result of multiple operations

## Number Expressions
**The Arithmetic Operators:**

'+' = Addition

'-' = Subtraction

'*' = Multiplication

'/' = Division

*Note:* In an expression, you can use a variable that already has an assigned value.

## String Expressions
You use the + symbol to join multiple strings together.

*Note:* Remember, numbers surrounded by single or double quotation marks are strings!

    Ex:
    '12' + '34' would be '1234' not 46!

## Boolean Expressions
The Boolean data type can only have a value of true or false.

For equality comparisons, you use the triple equals operator: ===

For inequality comparisons, you use the exclamation mark followed by two equals signs: !==

**Strict Equality vs. Loose Equality**
The symbols === and !== are **strict** equality and inequality operators.

== and != are loose equality operators. It's always (or most of the time) best practice to use **Strict** equality operators.

**Greater Than/Less than Comparisons**

'>' = Greater than

'<' = Less than

'>=' = Greater than or equals to

'<=' = Less than or equals to

**Compound Expression**

    And & Or:
    And: Both expressions must be true for the overall expression to be tru. (represented with &&)
    Or: Atleast one expression must be true for the overall expression to be true (represented with ||)

**Operator Precedence:**

Computer programs follow **PEMDAS**
