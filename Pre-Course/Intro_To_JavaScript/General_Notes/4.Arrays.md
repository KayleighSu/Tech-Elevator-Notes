# Arrays

You declare an array by using square brackets, and having your values separated by a comma.

*Example:*

    let scores = [87, 92, 83, 99, 82];

*Note:* You can leave the brackets blank and create an empty array!

Arrays can hold values of any valid data type. Just be sure that you are using the **same** data type.

The above example contains values commonly called *array elements*. Each element has an *index*. The first index is always 0 **not** 1!

## Array Functions
**Push, pop, and indexOf**

*Push*

Used to add or insert a new element to the end of an array.

*Pop*

Used to remove the last element of an array (doesn't accept any parameters.) You can assign the deleted element to a variable if your program needs to use it.

    Example:
    let deletedScore = scores.pop();

*indexOf*

Identifies the first location of a value within an array. Returns a -1 if the values does not appear in the array.
