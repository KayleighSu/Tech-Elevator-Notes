# Conditional Logic

**If, If-Else, and Nested If-Else**

An **If** statement consists of 3 distinct parts:
- The 'if' keyword
- A condition that evaluates to true or false
- A block of code that runs if the condition is true

*Note:* It's important to note that the code in an if statement only runs if it's **true**

*Example:*

    if (conditon) {
        //code block
    }

For **if else** statements:

*Example:*

    if (condition) {
        //code block
    } else {
        //code block
    }

*Note:* It's important to note that an *else* exists solely as an alternative to an if. You **cannot** use else alone

Also, for an if else statement, only one of the two code blocks will run!

**Nested if else** statements:

*Example:*

    if (condition) {
        if (followUpCondition) {
            //code block for if true
        } else {
            //code block for if false
        }
    } else {
        //code block if original condition is false
    }
