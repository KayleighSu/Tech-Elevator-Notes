# Leveraging AI

*Do use AI tools to:*

- Check your understanding of logical concepts and diagram components.
- Verify and improve the steps in a process.
- Suggest alternate solutions that you can compate to your own.
- Generate additional practice problems.

*Don't use AI tools to:*

- Give you solutions before you've thought through the problem yourself first.
- Generate Digarams.
- Generate diagrams containing a process of step that you don't understand.

*Tips:*

- The content you get back is more useful and applicable if you provide a solid context for the problem and the type of output that you're looking for.
- Explain the problem in your own words instead of using copy and paste. This helps to ensure that you understand the problem completely.
- These tools understand text, not diagrams, so you'll need to explain the steps for your process in words. This is a great first step, as it allows you to think through the problem and get feedback before spending time on creating a diagram.
- Remember that these tools aren't perfect. They can miss errors or omissions that another person might see. Don't use these tools as a substitute for engaging with your peers and support staff.

*Suggested Process:*

- Read through the problem and put it into your own words. If you don't understand the problem itself, ask the AI to help you clarify the problem. Be sure to tell it not to solve the problem for you, just to help you understand it better.
- Think through and outline the steps of the algorithm. **It is important to work through this on part on your own - this is the key skill you want to develop in this unit**
- Once steps are outlined, ask AI to validate it before you take the time to put it into a process diagram. Ask it to critique.
